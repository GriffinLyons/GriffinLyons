- 👋 Hi, I’m @GriffinLyons. This GitHub currently serves as my project portfolio in data science and data analytics.
-  I graduated in May 2024 with a Masters Degree in Applied Data Analytics from Metropolitan College at Boston University.
-     Before that, I worked at Amazon for more than five years, most of them in Amazon Data Services (ADS), as a Senior Data Associate  and then Machine Learning Associate-II.
-     My undergraduate degree was in theater with a minor in linguistics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (2016).
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and data analytics, particularly machine learning, the application of ML methods to knowledge organization and transformation, and sports analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: I am brushing up on my Tableau, Power BI, and Excel. My final course of my program was focused on big data analytics. I've learned how to use PySpark (Spark's API for Python) and run jobs on AWS EMR clusters.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
-     * unconventional applications of LLM/transformer/neural networks to data (think: identifying, retrieving, and/or transforming existing knowledge rather than creating new output in the fashion of ChatGPT);
-     * model development and deployment
-     * trend and data quality analysis at any scale
-     * sports analytics - I caught the analytics bug some time ago and I enjoy learning all about the different forms of analytics and their application to sports 😊
- 📫 How to reach me: You can message me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/griffinlyons/

- ⚡ Fun fact: I've seen the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean in person, but not the Pacific Ocean.
