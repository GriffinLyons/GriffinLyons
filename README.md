- 👋 Hi, I’m @GriffinLyons. I'm graduating in spring 2024 with a Masters Degree in Applied Data Analytics from Metropolitan College at Boston University.
-     Before that, I worked at Amazon for more than five years, most of them in Amazon Data Services (ADS), as a Senior Data Associate  and then Machine Learning Associate-II.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and data analytics, particularly machine learning, the application of ML methods to knowledge organization and transformation, and sports analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: My final course of my program is focused on big data analytics. I've learned how to use PySpark (Spark's API for Python) and run jobs on AWS EMR clusters.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
-     * unconventional applications of LLM/transformer/neural networks to data (think: identifying, retrieving, and/or transforming existing knowledge rather than creating new output in the fashion of ChatGPT);
-     * model development and deployment
-     * trend and data quality analysis at any scale
-     * sports analytics - I caught the analytics bug some time ago and I enjoy learning all about the different forms of analytics and their application to sports 😊
- 📫 How to reach me: You can message me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/griffinlyons/
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've seen the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean in person, but not the Pacific Ocean.
